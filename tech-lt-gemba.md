## Event streaming and data

* To make the Dynamic Scheduling PoC and most of our solutions possible, we need data.
* Most of this data comes from the EMP - Event streaming platform.
* It's really important for us, that data is easily available and hopefully we can stream even more data from the EMP in the future.
* We have built a package that makes it alot easier to consume data from the EMP.
* We're in the process of making it open-source and public for everyone to use and contribute.
* We have already a few teams in Maersk that use this package to make working with the event stream easier.
