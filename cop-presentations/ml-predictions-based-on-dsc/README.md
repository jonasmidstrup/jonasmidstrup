# Machine Learning predictions based on 7 years of dated schedules

## Categorization

* VesselCode
* ArrivalServiceCode
* Previous to current terminal code (A to B)
* RotationNumber? Has the rotation changed?

## Possible alternative use cases for this

* What is the hit rate for already actualized schedules based on the prediction model? (be careful because of COVID)
* How long does each vessel use in each port? How many moves was done and compared to vessel type and port?
* How good are we at creating schedules?
* How do we take this to a network level?
* How do we "remove" inaccurate/faulted data or wash the data?
